# LoRA Variants for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) require extensive computational resources for fine-tuning, making them difficult to adapt efficiently. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and its variants** provide parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that significantly reduce computational requirements while maintaining model performance. These methods enable faster adaptation, lower memory usage, and improved efficiency for various applications, including NLP, computer vision, and federated learning.

This repository presents a collection of LoRA variants, each designed to optimize model fine-tuning in different scenarios. Below is an in-depth explanation of each variant and how they contribute to efficient model training.

## 🚀 LoRA Variants

### 🔸 LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

- Introduces two **low-rank matrices (A and B)** alongside weight matrices W.
- Instead of fine-tuning all parameters, it **only updates these low-rank matrices**.
- This approach significantly **reduces the number of trainable parameters** while maintaining high performance.
- **Key Benefit:** Drastically lowers memory and compute requirements while allowing efficient model adaptation.

### 🔸 LoRA-FA (Frozen-A)

- An enhancement of LoRA where **matrix A is frozen**, and only **matrix B is updated**.
- This further **reduces activation memory requirements** while preserving efficiency.
- **Key Benefit:** Optimized for environments with strict memory constraints.

### 🔸 Delta-LoRA

- A hybrid approach combining **traditional fine-tuning with LoRA**.
- Instead of static updates, **matrix W is updated based on differences between consecutive training steps**.
- This results in a **more flexible adaptation mechanism** with better generalization.
- **Key Benefit:** Provides enhanced adaptability compared to standard LoRA.

### 🔸 LoRA+

- Optimizes LoRA convergence by **adjusting learning rates dynamically**.
- Uses a **higher learning rate for matrix B** compared to matrix A.
- This enables **faster and more stable training**.
- **Key Benefit:** Accelerates training without sacrificing stability.

### 🔸 DyLoRA (Dynamic LoRA)

- Unlike static LoRA, DyLoRA trains **multiple LoRA ranks simultaneously**.
- Enables **dynamic rank selection during inference**, eliminating the need for manual tuning.
- Avoids costly grid searches for optimal rank selection.
- **Key Benefit:** Adaptive training that selects the most efficient rank dynamically.

### 🔸 DP-DyLoRA

- Extends DyLoRA by incorporating **differential privacy**.
- Designed for **federated learning environments**, ensuring privacy while enabling fine-tuning.
- **Key Benefit:** Privacy-preserving adaptation with dynamic rank selection.

### 🔸 AdaLoRA (Adaptive LoRA)

- **Dynamically allocates** parameter budgets based on layer importance.
- Uses **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to identify the most important parameters.
- Outperforms standard LoRA by **optimizing parameter allocation**.
- **Key Benefit:** Smarter parameter allocation leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.

### 🔸 DoRA (Decomposed LoRA)

- Decomposes pre-trained weights into **magnitude and direction** components.
- Separately fine-tunes these components, achieving training behavior **closer to full fine-tuning**.
- **Key Benefit:** Mimics full fine-tuning with fewer parameters, improving adaptability.

### 🔸 VeRA (Vector-based Random Matrix Adaptation)

- Uses shared **random matrices A and B across all layers** instead of unique matrices per layer.
- Trains only **small, layer-specific scaling vectors**, significantly reducing trainable parameters.
- **Key Benefit:** Achieves a **97% reduction in trainable parameters** compared to standard LoRA.

### 🔸 LoHa (Low-Rank Hadamard Product)

- Uses **Hadamard product-based decomposition** instead of standard matrix operations.
- Breaks down weight updates into **four smaller matrices**, improving computational efficiency.
- Particularly effective in **computer vision tasks** where spatial structure matters.
- **Key Benefit:** Enhances efficiency in vision-related applications.

### 🔸 LoKr (Low-Rank Kronecker Product)

- Uses **Kronecker products** instead of traditional matrix multiplication.
- Maintains matrix rank while speeding up parameter updates through **column stacking**.
- **Key Benefit:** Reduces computation time while maintaining performance.

### 🔸 LoRA-drop

- Selectively applies **LoRA adapters to only the most important layers**.
- Evaluates layer importance based on **output magnitude** to minimize unnecessary computation.
- **Key Benefit:** Reduces computational cost while preserving model accuracy.

### 🔸 QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)

- **Quantizes weight parameters** to **4-bit precision**, allowing large models to be fine-tuned with minimal hardware.
- Enables fine-tuning of **65B parameter models on a single GPU**.
- Maintains model performance while **drastically reducing memory usage**.
- **Key Benefit:** Enables LLM fine-tuning on resource-constrained hardware.
